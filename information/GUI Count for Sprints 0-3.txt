Part 2: Methodology: Defining and Quantifying a "GUI"

To ensure an accurate and actionable count, a precise methodology is established. This framework defines the unit of measure and the analytical model used for this audit.

Defining the Unit of Measure

The user query requests a count of "pages." For the purpose of this technical audit, this term is insufficient. The project's technology stack includes Jetpack Compose 1, a component-based UI toolkit. Therefore, a "GUI" is defined as:
Any unique screen, page, view, or distinct modal/pop-up that requires a discrete design, development, and testing effort.
This rigorous definition is necessary because a modal pop-up—such as one for "Split Bill," as implied by UC-6 1—often contains its own complex business logic, state management, and UI components. It represents a distinct development task separate from the screen that launches it. This methodology prevents critical under-scoping of the development workload.

The "Three-Application" Analytical Model

A foundational finding from the Group Project Report.txt 1 is that this project does not entail one application, but rather three distinct front-end applications that communicate via the Firebase backend.1
Failing to differentiate these three development tracks would result in a catastrophic miscalculation of the project's scope. The total GUI count is the sum of GUIs across all three applications. The analysis is therefore structured around these parallel systems:
The Customer Application: This is the system depicted in the provided example images (Image 1, Image 2, Image 3). It is the primary interface for end-users (Customers) and fulfills user stories such as UC-1 (place order), UC-2 (pay for order), and UC-3 (track order).1
The Server/Staff Application: This is a professional Point-of-Sale (POS) terminal, not depicted in the images. This application is used by Restaurant Staff (Server/Waiter).1 It fulfills entirely different user stories: UC-4 (create table order), UC-5 (modify order), and UC-6 (process bill).1 Its UI must be optimized for speed, error minimization, and operational efficiency, not customer-facing aesthetics.
The Kitchen Application: This is a Kitchen Display System (KDS), also not depicted. It is used by Kitchen Staff 1 and fulfills UC-7 (see new orders) and UC-8 (update order status).1 This interface is focused on real-time data display and simple status updates.

Part 3: Sprint 0 Analysis: Foundational and Prerequisite GUIs

Sprint 0, "Project Setup & Planning," has no explicit user stories but is critical for establishing the "scaffolding" required for all subsequent sprints.1 The functional requirement FR-ADM-402 (Access Control) 1, which mandates role-based access control (RBAC), provides the primary justification for these foundational screens, as it proves the need for distinct login mechanisms for different user roles.
Required GUIs for Sprint 0:
Customer Application (Prerequisites for UC-1):
Splash Screen: A standard loading screen for a native Android application.1
Log In Screen: This GUI is explicitly provided in Image 2. It serves as the entry point for existing users, as required by the RBAC system.1
Registration Screen: Logically implied by the existence of a "Log In" screen. A flow must exist for new customers to create an account.
Forgot/Reset Password Screen: A necessary and standard component of any user authentication workflow.
Main Application Shell: This is the core container for the entire customer app, explicitly shown in Image 1. It includes the non-functional-in-this-sprint bottom navigation bar with five tabs (Main, Coupon, Order, Member, Other). This shell must be built in Sprint 0 to host the Sprint 1 features.
Server (POS) Application (Prerequisites for UC-4):
6. Server/POS Login Screen: A distinct login interface for staff, separate from the customer's. This is mandated by FR-ADM-403 1 and would likely use a PIN or staff ID rather than an email.
Kitchen (KDS) Application (Prerequisites for UC-7):
7. KDS Login Screen: A third, distinct login portal for kitchen staff, also required by the RBAC implementation 1 to secure the KDS.
Sprint 0 Summary: This setup sprint necessitates the creation of 7 foundational GUIs as prerequisites for any functional development.

Part 4: Sprint 1 Analysis: Core Ordering and Kitchen View

Sprint 1's goal is "Core Ordering & Kitchen View".1 This sprint begins functional development on the Customer and Kitchen applications.
User Stories:
UC-1: Customer can view the menu and place an order. 1
UC-7: Kitchen staff can see a real-time list of new orders. 1
GUI Breakdown for UC-1 (Customer App):
This user story describes a multi-step user flow, not a single screen.
8. Menu/Ordering Screen: This is the primary screen shown in Image 1. It displays the menu list, item prices, category tabs (Type1, Type2, Type3), and order type selection (Dine in, Takeaway).
9. Restaurant Selection Screen: The "Change restaurant" link visible in Image 1 explicitly requires a separate GUI (likely a list or map view) to allow the user to select a different branch.
10. Item Details & Customization Screen: Clicking "Order Now" from the list in Image 1 is insufficient. FR-OM-102 (Customization) 1 mandates that the system must allow users to apply customizations (e.g., "no onion," "extra cheese"). This requires a new GUI (a full page or modal) that appears after item selection but before the item is added to the cart.
11. Shopping Cart / Order Summary Screen: After adding items, a user must be able to review their complete order, check quantities, and see a subtotal. This is a standard and necessary screen in any e-commerce flow.
12. Order Submitted Modal: Since UC-2 (Payment) is not scheduled until Sprint 3 1, the "place an order" flow for Sprint 1 must conclude with a simple, non-financial submission. This GUI would be a simple "Order Submitted!" confirmation modal.
GUI Breakdown for UC-7 (Kitchen App):
This is the first functional GUI for the KDS, following the KDS Login (GUI #7).
13. KDS Main Dashboard (Order-Ticket View): This screen directly fulfills UC-7 by providing the "real-time list of new orders".1 It would display incoming orders as a queue of digital "tickets" for the kitchen staff to manage.
Sprint 1 Summary: This sprint adds 6 new GUIs to the project (5 for the Customer App, 1 for the Kitchen App).

Part 5: Sprint 2 Analysis: Order Management and Status Tracking

Sprint 2's goal is "Order Management & Status Tracking".1 This is the most complex sprint in the analyzed range, as it requires concurrent development on all three applications and introduces the Server (POS) app.
User Stories:
UC-4: Server can create a table order. 1
UC-5: Server can modify an existing order. 1
UC-3: Customer can track their order status. 1
UC-8: Kitchen staff can update an order's status. 1
GUI Breakdown for UC-4 & UC-5 (Server App):
This is the core of the POS system, for which no visual reference exists. These GUIs must be inferred from the user stories and functional requirements.
14. POS Main Dashboard / Table Map Screen: After logging in (GUI #6), the server needs a home screen. This would logically be a visual map of the restaurant's tables, showing their status (e.g., open, occupied). This is directly supported by FR-OM-101 (assign order to a table).1
15. Server Order Entry Screen: This screen is the primary tool for UC-4.1 After selecting a table (from GUI #14), the server uses this interface to add menu items. It would be optimized for staff, not customers (e.g., quick-add buttons, search by item code). It would also be the interface used to edit an order, thus also supporting UC-5.
16. Order List & Search Screen (POS): To fulfill UC-5 (modify an existing order) 1, a server must first be able to find that order. This GUI provides a list or search function for all active orders, searchable by table, customer, or time.
GUI Breakdown for UC-3 (Customer App):
This user story "activates" the "Order" tab from the main application shell (GUI #5, shown in Image 1).
17. Order History List Screen: When the customer taps the "Order" tab, this GUI will be displayed, listing their pending and past orders.
18. Live Order Status Tracker Screen: When a user taps a pending order from the list (GUI #17), they are taken to this screen. This GUI fulfills UC-3 by visualizing the order's progress (e.g., "Confirmed," "Preparing," "Ready for Pickup"). These statuses are fed from the KDS, which is updated via UC-8.1
GUI Breakdown for UC-8 (Kitchen App):
This user story makes the KDS (GUI #13) interactive.
19. Ticket Detail & Update Modal: The KDS Main Dashboard (GUI #13) shows a list of tickets. UC-8 1 and FR-OM-104 1 require staff to "update the order status." Tapping a ticket must launch this new modal, which would display item details and provide the necessary buttons (e.g., "Mark as Preparing," "Mark as Ready") to update the order's state.
Sprint 2 Summary: This critical sprint adds 6 new GUIs (3 for the Server App, 2 for the Customer App, 1 for the Kitchen App).
