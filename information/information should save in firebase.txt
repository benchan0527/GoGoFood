1. User & Access Control Collections
You mentioned storing user name and password. It's important to clarify this Firebase Authentication should handle the actual secure storage of passwords and authentication. Your Firestore database will then store the profile data associated with that user's unique ID (UID).

users Collection

Purpose Stores a document for every individual who registers, whether a customer or staff.

Document Data userName, email, phone, createdDate, and most importantly, role.

Role-Based Access (RBAC) This role field (e.g., customer, server, kitchen, manager) is critical. It fulfills your FR-ADM-403 (Access Control) requirement. Your app's security rules will use this field to determine who can see and edit what. For example, only a user with the role kitchen can access the KDS, and only role manager can edit the menu.   

2. Business Profile & Operations Collections
This category covers the static (but updatable) information about your restaurant.

branches (or restaurants) Collection

Purpose Stores a document for each restaurant location. This directly supports the West Street Branch and Change restaurant feature seen in Image 1.

Document Data branchName (e.g., West Street Branch), address, phoneNumber, geolocation (latitudelongitude), and openingHours.

tables Collection

Purpose Manages the state of physical tables in the restaurant, essential for the Server (POS) app and UC-4 Server can create a table order.   

Document Data tableNumber (e.g., A1), status (e.g., available, occupied, needs_cleaning), currentOrderID, branchId (to link it to a specific branch).

3. Menu & Inventory Collections
You are already storing the menu, which is great. A more scalable approach is to break it down into flexible, linked collections.

menuCategories Collection

Purpose Stores your menu categories. This directly populates the Type1, Type2, Type3 tabs in Image 1.

Document Data categoryName (e.g., Type1), displayOrder.

menuItems Collection

Purpose A document for every single dish you offer, like Clayfrot Rice or Peking Duck (Images 1 & 3).

Document Data name, description, basePrice ($49, $41, etc.), imageUrl, categoryId (to link it to a category), isAvailable (so a manager can 86 an item).

itemModifiers Collection (Advanced)

Purpose Manages customizations, as required by FR-OM-102 (Customization).   

Document Data modifierGroup (e.g., Size, Add-ons), options (e.g., or [Extra Cheese, No Onion]), additionalPrice. These can be linked to menuItems.

ingredients Collection (Advanced)

Purpose Required for FR-IN-201 (Real-Time Stock Tracking).   

Document Data ingredientName (e.g., Chicken Breast, Onion), currentStockLevel, lowStockThreshold (for FR-IN-202 alerts).

4. Order & Transaction Collections
This is the most active and important part of your database, handling the record for ordering.

orders Collection

Purpose A new document is created here for every order (e.g., Order #1234 from Image 3). This collection is the heart of the system, read by all three apps.

Document Data

orderNumber (e.g., 1234).

userId Links to the customer.

branchId Links to the branch.

tableNumber If it's a dine-in order.

status The most critical field. It will be updated by the kitchen (e.g., Pending - Preparing - Ready for Pickup). This directly powers UC-3 (Customer track), UC-7 (Kitchen see), and UC-8 (Kitchen update).   

items An array of objects, storing a snapshot of the item details (name, price, customizations) at the time of ordering.

subtotal, tax, discount, grandTotal.

paymentStatus (e.g., Unpaid, Paid).

deliveryTime (e.g., Standed (10-20mins) from Image 3).

transactions Collection

Purpose Stores a record for every payment attempt, supporting UC-2 (Customer pay) and UC-6 (Server process bill).   

Document Data orderId, paymentMethod (e.g., Credit Card), amount, transactionId (from the payment gateway), status (Success, Failed).

5. Configuration & Analytics Collections
These collections help you manage the app and analyze its performance.

appConfig Collection

Purpose Solves your update the app problem for global settings. Your app fetches this single document on launch.

Document Data A single document (e.g., settings) containing taxRate, serviceCharge, supportedPaymentMethods (for FR-PAY-302 ), or special promotion banners. Change the tax rate here, and every app reflects it instantly.   

dailySalesReports Collection (for Analytics)

Purpose Supports UC-10 Manager can generate a daily sales report.   

Document Data Instead of costly queries on the entire orders collection, you can run a scheduled function to aggregate sales data and store it in a document named for that day (e.g., report-2025-11-04). This document would contain totalSales, totalOrders, topSellingItem, etc.. For more advanced needs, you could use the BigQuery extension.
