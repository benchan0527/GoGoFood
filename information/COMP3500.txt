Project background

Many small restaurants continue to use manual ordering which presents delays, errors and poor customer experience.This is presumably a chain restaurant, so it probably has individual memberships and vouchers.Our project will target the enhancement of customer experience when it comes to ordering and efficiency.(Vertical Bullet List)
