EVIDENCE FROM SYSTEM MODELING

Our group conducted comprehensive system modeling sessions to develop the Restaurant Ordering System use cases. Below is the evidence of our collaborative process:

---

1. GROUP MEETING VIDEO RECORDING

Description: 15-minute video recording of our modeling session held on [DATE], where we discussed:
- Identification of system actors (Customer, Server, Kitchen Staff, Manager)
- Definition of use case boundaries and scope
- Discussion of functional requirements for each use case
- Decision-making process for system features

SUMMARY OF MODELING PROCESS

Our group followed a systematic approach to system modeling:

1. Requirements Analysis (Session 1, [DATE]):
   - Reviewed the Restaurant Ordering System requirements document
   - Identified stakeholders and their needs
   - Listed potential system features

2. Actor Identification (Session 2, [DATE]):
   - Brainstormed all possible users of the system
   - Grouped users into 4 primary actors
   - Defined roles and responsibilities for each actor

3. Use Case Development (Session 3, [DATE]):
   - Generated comprehensive list of system functions
   - Applied use case delimitation principles
   - Selected 10 core use cases that cover major system functionality
   - Ensured balanced distribution across actors

4. Diagram Creation (Session 4, [DATE]):
   - Created use case diagram using draw.io
   - Added relationships (include, extend) where appropriate
   - Reviewed and refined the diagram as a group

5. Individual Sequence Diagrams (Week [X]):
   - Each member selected one use case
   - Created detailed sequence diagrams
   - Documented interaction flows and system components

This evidence demonstrates our collaborative system modeling process and shows how we arrived at our final design through group discussion, iteration, and refinement.
