Agile (1 of 2)
• Agile means being able to move quickly and easily
o Existing project management approaches do not allow people to work quickly or easily
o Early software development projects often used a waterfall approach
o As technology and businesses become more complex, a project management approach is needed where requirements are often unknown or continuously changing.
• Today, Agile means an approach where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration.

Manifesto for Agile Software Development: https://agilemanifesto.org
• In February 2001, a group of 17 people that called itself the Agile Alliance developed and agreed on the Manifesto for Agile Software Development
• “We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
o Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
o Working software over comprehensive documentation
o Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
o Responding to change over following a plan “
